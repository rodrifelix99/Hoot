<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between you and The NONIC Corporation, operating as Hoot ("Hoot," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, creating an account on, or using the Hoot mobile application, website, or any related products or services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and any additional policies referenced herein. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Services.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and have full power and authority to enter into these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

<h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
<p>To access certain features of the Services, such as posting hoots or following feeds, you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to update such information to keep it accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities occurring under your account. Hoot is not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<h2>4. Description of Services</h2>
<p>Hoot is a community-first social network that allows users to create posts ("hoots") containing text, images, or GIFs; follow other users; subscribe to thematic feeds; receive notifications; and interact with content. We may add, remove, or modify features at any time in our sole discretion without notice or liability.</p>

<h2>5. User Content</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of content you post or submit through the Services ("User Content"). By posting User Content, you grant Hoot a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, host, store, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, display, and otherwise exploit such User Content for any purpose connected to operating, improving, or marketing the Services. You represent and warrant that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to your User Content and that your User Content does not infringe or violate any third-party rights.</p>

<h2>6. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post unlawful, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or otherwise objectionable content.</li>
  <li>Harass, threaten, or impersonate others.</li>
  <li>Use the Services for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent.</li>
  <li>Access or use accounts or data of other users without authorization.</li>
  <li>Upload viruses, malware, or other harmful code.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer, scrape, or data-mine the Services.</li>
  <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may remove or refuse to publish any User Content, suspend or terminate accounts, or otherwise restrict access to the Services at our sole discretion without notice or liability.</p>

<h2>7. Community Guidelines</h2>
<p>Users must follow all Community Guidelines made available within the Services. These guidelines may be updated periodically, and your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of those updates.</p>

<h2>8. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Certain features of the Services may require payment. All fees are non-refundable unless required by law. We may change pricing at any time, but changes will not affect purchases already completed. If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew at the stated interval unless canceled before the renewal date. You authorize us to charge your payment method for all applicable fees.</p>

<h2>9. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
<p>The Services may integrate or link to third-party services, content, or websites. Hoot does not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for any third-party services or content. Your interactions with third parties are solely between you and the third party, and you agree that Hoot is not liable for any damages or losses arising from such interactions.</p>

<h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Services, including all software, design, text, graphics, images, logos, and other materials created by or for Hoot, are owned by Hoot or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the limited license granted to you to use the Services, no rights are transferred to you. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services without our prior written consent.</p>

<h2>11. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, including if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable laws. Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease, and you must cease all use of the Services. Sections of these Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination will survive, including intellectual property rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnity provisions.</p>

<h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Services are free of viruses or other harmful components. Your use of the Services is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Hoot, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, or service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) the Services. Our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid us, if any, during the six months preceding the event giving rise to the claim or (b) one hundred euros (â‚¬100). The foregoing limitations apply even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages and regardless of the theory of liability.</p>

<h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Hoot and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

<h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms and any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to them or the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Portugal, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be the courts located in Lisbon, Portugal, and you waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.</p>

<h2>16. Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy with Hoot will be resolved exclusively through individual litigation in the courts of Lisbon, Portugal. You expressly waive any right to participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration or proceeding against Hoot.</p>

<h2>17. Changes to the Services</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any part thereof at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.</p>

<h2>18. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date above. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using the Services.</p>

<h2>19. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>

<h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms, together with any policies referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Hoot regarding your use of the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and proposals, whether oral or written.</p>
